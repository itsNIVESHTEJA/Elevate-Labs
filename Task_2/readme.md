## 1. Project Flow

The project follows a systematic flow to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset. Below are the steps involved in the analysis:

### Step 1: Load the Dataset
- Begin by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.

### Step 2: Describe the Data
- Use descriptive statistics to understand the key features and summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) of the dataset.

### Step 3: Data Cleaning
- Clean the data by:
  - Dropping unwanted columns that are not useful for analysis.
  - Identifying and handling null values through imputation (mean, median, mode based on the data type of each column).
  - Mapping categorical variables to numerical values where necessary (e.g., encoding labels or converting text to numeric values).
  - Removing or handling duplicates to ensure the quality of the data.

### Step 4: Data Analysis through Visualization
- Generate visualizations to gain insights into the data:
  - **Histograms**: To understand the distribution of numerical data.
  - **Countplots**: To count the occurrences of categories or labels in categorical data.
  - **Correlation Plots**: To show relationships between numeric features and detect potential multicollinearity.
  - **Boxplots**: To identify outliers in numerical data and assess the spread and skewness of the data.
  
### Step 5: Feature-Level Inferences
- Based on the visualizations and descriptive statistics, make inferences regarding:
  - Data distributions, potential transformations, and feature engineering.
  - Presence of outliers, trends, and relationships between features.

## 2. Data Cleaning Steps

The data cleaning phase ensures that the dataset is ready for analysis and modeling.

### 2.1 Drop Unwanted Columns
- Drop columns that are irrelevant or redundant for the analysis, such as IDs or any feature that doesn't contribute useful information.

### 2.2 Identify Null Values
- Check for missing values across the dataset and decide how to handle them:
  - **Numeric columns**: Fill missing values with the mean or median.
  - **Categorical columns**: Fill missing values with the mode or a predefined category.

### 2.3 Impute Missing Data
- Impute missing values using appropriate strategies:
  - Mean/Median for numerical data.
  - Mode for categorical data.

### 2.4 Mapping for Categorical Columns
- Map categorical variables to numerical values for model compatibility, e.g., "Male" = 0, "Female" = 1.

## 3. Plots and Visualizations

Visualization plays a critical role in understanding data distribution, patterns, and relationships between features.

### 3.1 Histograms
- Use histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical features and check for skewness.
### 3.2 Countplots
Use countplots to visualize the frequency of categories in a categorical feature.
## 3.3 Correlation Plots
Visualize the correlation matrix to understand how numerical features relate to each other.
## 3.4 Boxplots
Use boxplots to identify outliers and assess the spread of numerical features.


## 4. Libraries Used
To complete the data cleaning and visualization tasks, the following Python libraries were used:

Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.

Matplotlib: For creating visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and countplots.

Seaborn: For advanced statistical plotting, including correlation heatmaps and pairplots.
